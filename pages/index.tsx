                  What is this account abstraction ðŸ¤”
                </h1>
                <p className={"mb-4"}>
                  A standard <b>(ERC-4337)</b> native to Ethereum and all EVM-based blockchains.
                  Account abstraction within blockchain systems allows for assets to be held by smart contracts rather than being controlled by <b>externally-owned accounts (EOAs)</b>.
                  It allows users to use smart contracts as their primary accounts. It essentially turns EOAs into smart contract-enabled accounts.
                </p>
                <p className={"mb-4"}>
                  Different dimensions of Account Abstraction includes: <i>Signature Abstraction</i>, <i>Fee Abstractions</i>, and <i>Nonce Abstraction</i>.
                </p>
                <p className={"mb-4"}>
                  <b>Signature Abstraction: </b> No need of <b>Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA)</b> signatures, as the default authorization mechanism.
                  Rather, users are permitted to define custom rules for authorizing wallets to initiate transactions.
                </p>
                <p className={"mb-4"}><b>Fee Abstraction</b>:  Enables gasless transactions, using <b>relayers</b>.</p>
                <p className={"mb-4"}><b>Nonce Abstraction</b>: Allows to create custom replay protection mechanisms (instead of the Ethereum protocol enforcing strict ordering on transactions).
                We can have a nonce scheme that permits processing multiple transactions in parallel,
                  (Smart accounts have another feature called transaction batching, with which, we can combine multiple operations into a single transaction to reduce the cost and complexity)
                This would solve the problem of clogged/stuck transactions and significantly improve interactions with dapps.</p>

                  How does ERC-4337 work? ðŸ’¡
                </h1>
                <p>
                 ERC-4337 introduces a pseudo-transaction object called a <b>UserOperation</b>,
                  which sends a transaction on {"user's"} behalf.
                  Unconfirmed UserOperation transactions are stored in an <b>alt mempool</b>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Nodes on Ethereum network can choose to act as a <b>Bundler</b>, which picks up multiple such UserOperations and packs into a single transaction known as bundle transaction.
                  Bundle transactions are sent to a global smart contract known as the <b>EntryPoint</b>, where every individual UserOperation is verified and executed by calling different functions.
                </p>
                <p>
                   UserOperations can include any type of logic, it allows users to implement various customizations to how they want to manage their accounts and the funds in them.
